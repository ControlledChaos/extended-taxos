# Extended Taxonomies

A library which provides extended functionality to WordPress custom taxonomies, allowing you to quickly build custom taxonomies without having to write the same code again and again.

This is a sister library to [Extended CPTs](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts).

This library has plenty of inline documention in its code, but I haven't written anything in the readme or wiki yet. You should [yell at me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnbillion).
